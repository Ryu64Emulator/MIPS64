# MIPS64
A simple MIPS assembler targeting the Nintendo 64.
Currently not a whole lot going on, but it should have the framework there

# TODO
Some things that I'd like to accomplish are
1. A way to include multiple files
2. A way to compile to .z64
3. Every single instruction implemented in the assembler

# Things this could be used for
This is laid out as a Class Library so this can be used for almost anything (Including the emulator [Ryu64](https://github.com/Ryu64Emulator/Ryu64))
one thing that'd be pretty cool to use this for is a C Compiler, something that compiles to Assembly then uses this assembler to compile
to machine code, in the "RAW" format or the "Z64" format, another thing that it'll inevitably be used for (And it's main goal is to be used for)
is [Ryu64 the Nintendo 64 emulator.](https://github.com/Ryu64Emulator/Ryu64)
